## Gnomes Inc. release notes

Everything what you can see here, is a one-man-one-tomuchfreetime job. Don't blame me for anything. Ask questions. 
Questions are good. Like chocolate. The difference is, that someone cares about chocolate and probably no one will care about
any questions related with this project. 

Exception:
If you want to add something into project or suggest some fuckup inside of it.
Then please write to banach.krystian at gmail. I promise I'll give you potato if you want one!

Slava.
